# Fractals. Sierpinski Triangle.
Project with canvas experiment. There are basic shapes, color squares and fractal.

## What Is Sierpinski Triangle?
Fractal, which is named after the Polish mathematician
Wacław Franciszek Sierpiński (1882 – 1969). It can be created by starting with one large, equilateral triangle, and then repeatedly cutting smaller triangles out of its center.
## Chaos Game
Let’s play a simple game: we pick one of the vertices of the triangle at random, draw a line segment between our point and the vertex, and then find the midpoint of that segment.

Now we repeat the process: we pick another random vertex, draw the segment from our last point, and then find the midpoint. Note that we colour these new points based on the colour of the vertex of the triangle we picked.

This process is called the Chaos Game. There might be a few stray points at the beginning, but if you repeat the same steps many times, the distribution of dots starts to look exactly like the Sierpinski triangle!
